Project description:
this prject need us to implent a class and a main function. It aims to make us better understand how to deal with a class and how to use makefile to compile and link in Linux environment.

I create a class name food. It has three members: Name which is the name of the class, color which is the color of the food and its price. I make price as the static one due to the fact they are sold in dollar shop. So their price are almost same.

Project Specification:
1. the class contains a data attribute this is static.
2. the class has a static function that accesses the static function.
3.the class contains a data which is a pointer but not static. At the same time, it has set and get static functions.
4.the class is written in canonical form.
5.the class use assignment to initialization.
6. I use valgrind to test the file and there is no leek in the program.
7.the class contains four overload operators which are "=,<<,+,-"
8.also the class is a food class every member has its meaning.


Project Problem:
I am puzzled about how to convert  char* to string. Sometime I think they have the goals. But string class has more functions than the char*.

Extra: none
